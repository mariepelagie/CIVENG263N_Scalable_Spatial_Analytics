**Project:** An Analysis of a global food supply chain by product (focus on coffee) and investigating impact of supply side disruptions.

**Abstract:** Food insecurity is contemporarily exacerbated by increased globalization in an ever growing world. More so, increased agricultural exchange between countries championed by advances in farming and logistics technology has led to more complex food networks. Certain economies especially regions with low agricultural yield rely on imports for food and are susceptible to food insecurity and negative disruptions to the global food network. Highly connected global food supply chains are extremely vulnerable as both local disruption could entirely cripple the global food network and lead to long term reduced food access globally.
Understanding the impact of disruption on Agricultural supply chains becomes important in the analysis of the global movement of agricultural products. The aim of this project is to carry out an exploratory analysis on a global coffee demand and supply data set inorder to observe the changing trends in key network topological and robustness metrics over time. This analysis is a first step to understanding the effects of supply side disruptions on the movement of food at the global scale.
